# Purpose: Download and install the latest version of Skype Call Recorder

	## You need to provide your own private URL to download Skype Call Recorder. You should have received this
	## in an email when you first registered it. So the question is: “How do you share a public script with private
	## information in it?”
	##
	## Answer: Put the secret bit in a separate file which is read into the main script.
	##
	## So, create a file "$HOME/.config/di/private/di-skypecallrecorder.txt" with a line like this in it:
	##
	## 	https://www.ecamm.com/cgi-bin/customercenter?u=you%40example%2Ecom&c=ABCDEF
	##
	#### Replace that with your actual URL
PRIVATE_FILE="$HOME/.config/di/private/di-skypecallrecorder.txt"
