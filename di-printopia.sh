	# OK, so here's where we do the very clever parsing of our XML_FEED
	# which is fortunately very well-formed and easy to parse.
	#
	# So, we are creating a variable "$INFO" which will be split at newlines (IFS takes care of that)
	# we use egrep to limit the output only to the 8 fields we care about
	# we use 'head' to limit the output to the first 8 lines (8 fields of egrep, head -8, not a coincidence)
	# sed removes any whitespace at the beginning of the lines (that's a tab and a space in the [brackets]
	# tr gets rid of " and , characters (yes, 'sed' could do that, but I like using 'tr' as it seems more clear)
	# we use 'sort' to make sure that the 7 lines are in a predictable order, even if the order in the XML_FEED
	# 	changes at some point in the future
	# lastly we use awk to split each line at the spaces and get the 2nd field after each :
	# 	well-formed XML really makes things easier

	## 2018-10-03 - there's now a 'sha2_512' and 'sha3_512'.
