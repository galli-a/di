# 2018-08-04:
# XML_FEED='https://data-cdn.mbamupdates.com/v1/mbam-mac/updates.xml'
# That feed is nothing but an attractive nuisance, that is to say, it's mostly useless.
# The current version of the app doesn't even include it.
# It no longer includes an actual download link. Instead, they tell you to go to https://malwarebytes.com/mac
#
# https://malwarebytes.com/mac led me to
# https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac-download/ which led me to
# https://downloads.malwarebytes.com/file/mb3-mac which led me to
# https://data-cdn.mbamupdates.com/web/mb3_mac/Malwarebytes-Mac-3.3.32.1398.pkg
#
# Ugh. It's a pkg file.
# Might need this later: https://data-cdn.mbamupdates.com/web/mb3_mac/Remove_Malwarebytes_Mac_3.0.zip
#
# Anyway... Wow. Was this trip really necessary?
#
# I assume '3.3.32.1398' is some sort of version number.
# Of course, the XML_Feed also seems to lack version numbers.
#
# Aha, after installing, I found this:
# /Applications/Malwarebytes.app:
# 	CFBundleShortVersionString: 3.3
# 	CFBundleVersion: 3.3.32.1398
#
# so at least we can compare 'CFBundleVersion' to see if we are up-to-date.

# Anyway, this seems to get us the download URL we need
